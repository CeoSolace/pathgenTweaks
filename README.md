# **PathTweaks**  
### *Advanced Multi-Function Game Performance Optimizer*  
> **Optimize. Elevate. Dominate.**

---

PathTweaks is a professional-grade, subscription-managed Windows optimization suite engineered exclusively for competitive gamers. Designed for **Fortnite**, **Valorant**, and **Call of Duty**, it delivers deep, multi-layered system enhancements to maximize FPS, reduce input latency, stabilize network performance, and eliminate background interference—**without violating anti-cheat policies**.

---

## 🔐 **Security & Compliance**

- ✅ **Anti-Cheat Safe**: Zero kernel hooks, memory injection, or driver-level modifications  
- 📡 **Minimal Telemetry**: Only your registered **username** and **public IP** are transmitted—for subscription validation  
- 🧹 **No Background Processes**: Runs on-demand and exits cleanly after execution  
- ↩️ **Fully Reversible**: All optimizations use standard Windows APIs and registry settings—easily undone via system settings

## 🔁 **Secure Update Mechanism**

PathTweaks checks for updates **exclusively** from the official source:  
🔗 [https://github.com/ceoSolace/pathgenTweaks](https://github.com/ceoSolace/pathgenTweaks)

- Only **`PathTweaks.ps1`** is ever updated—**no other files are downloaded or modified**  
- Updates are **user-approved**—nothing installs silently  
- Integrity verified via SHA-256 hash comparison  

---

## 🛡️ **Subscription Enforcement**

Access is dynamically managed through our secure backend:

- On first use, your **username + IP** are registered with `pathgenTweaks`  
- If your subscription expires, **all tweak execution halts immediately**  
- Reactivation requires a valid subscription and re-authentication  
- Admins can **remotely revoke access** at any time via the management dashboard  

> 🔒 Your system remains protected—no tweaks run without active authorization.
